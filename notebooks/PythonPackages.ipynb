We will now introduce Python packages, which allow us to use Python code that other people wrote and published. We are going to look at some common Python packages that will show up in DESI High tutorials. Specifically, we will introduce the following packages:\n",

    "Your map will look like a big blue rectangle at first. Why is that? Where are all the galaxies? It turns out that we can't see the galaxies yet because the scatter function has drawn them too large, and they all overlap each other. To fix this, we can use the size parameter `s`. **Add `s=0.5` as the third parameter input to `pyplot.scatter` and rerun the cell.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you should be able to see the galaxies! You'll notice that some regions of the map have a lot of galaxies. These locations are called **galaxy clusters**, and there can be tens of thousands of galaxies  bound together by gravity inside of them. There are also areas with very few galaxies. These locations are called **cosmic voids**, and they are some of the emptiest regions of our universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Finally, let's add a legend to our map. To do this, we first need to add `label = 'Bright Galaxy Survey'`as the fourth parameter in our `pyplot.scatter` input. Then, on the line below`pyplot.scatter`, type `pyplot.legend(framealpha=1, markerscale=5, loc='upper left')`. Rerun the cell, and you'll see a legend added in the corner.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our legend tells us that the galaxies we are plotting come from the DESI Bright Galaxy Survey, which is one of several galaxy catalogs that DESI is putting together. The Bright Galaxy Survey is a detailed map of the universe within seven billion light-years of our own galaxy. That sounds like a large distance, but the Bright Galaxy Survey is actually one of the closest DESI catalogs to us. Other DESI catalogs map out the locations of various types of galaxies that are located even farther away!"
